                            JavaScript is a type of ineffectual computer virus, first created in 1995 by the well known
                            script kiddie Brendan Eich of the trolling organisation "Mozilla".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The early web was a surprisingly safe environment, one in which a parent could allow their
                            child to roam as free as Adam. Acting in response to this, the Java computer virus was
                            created to annoy and mentally disturb Internet viewers. Java, however, was limited in its
                            ability to wreck havoc, being more or less restricted to slowing down the loading of a web
                            page; not a particularly effective means of annoying people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript, ( "Java" + "Script Kiddie" ), was an attempt to improve the virus's
                            effectiveness. One of its early success stories was the ability to cause one image to be
                            replaced by another when the user would roll over it. This confusion tactic was simple, but
                            ultimately lead to better forms of Internet harassment. The height of its popularity within
                            the hacker community came when the "Pop-up Technique" was created, a truly brilliant way to
                            lock a user into view hundreds of porn sites with no way to exit their browser. Unlike most
                            viruses, JavaScript uses a "prototype-based object-unoriented paradigm", rather than the
                            traditional class/instance model. It is also "loosely typed", meaning 1+1 = 11. However, in
                            some earlier versions of Internet Explorer, 1+1 did in fact equal a window. An international
                            trolling organisation called the ECMA, ("European Collective Masturbation Association"),
                            created their own JavaScript virus, called ECMAScript. This now legendary version is used as
                            the basis of several well known viruses, including "ActionScript" used in the trojan horse
                            "Macromedia Flash". For a much more effective virus with which to annoy people, see
                            VBScript.

                        <header>Object unorientation in JavaScript</header>

                        <p>
                            Even though JavaScript was not invented by Microsoft, its model is still stupid enough to be
                            considered acceptable. JavaScript's most essential feature is objects. Every object in
                            JavaScript has one of two possible orientations: positive and negative. Objects oriented in
                            a positive way have their normal vectors parallel to the object itself and the call:
                        </p>

                        <code>Object.getUnorientation()</code>

                        <p>
                            will return a non-real number roughly indicating the current volume of the speakers from the
                            following set:
                        </p>

                        <img
                            src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b091121d873ce6b986e81d6c884c28c66255c76"
                            alt="crazy math going on here"
                        />

                        <p>
                            Objects whose orientation is negative don't have normal vectors at all (although in some
                            rare instances it was observed that the length of all such vectors was no longer than the
                            cord of the mouse). Although using negatively-oriented objects is sometimes not advised, if
                            used properly they could greatly add to the number of bugs in the code - the technique
                            called Proper Object Syntax (POS) or as formally defined in ECMAScript specification: Proper
                            Unorientable Syntax Interface (PUSI). Just as positively oriented objects, negatively
                            oriented objects also support calls in the form:
                        </p>

                        <code>Object.getUnorientation()</code>

                        <p>
                            As every well-trained web designer knows, the best way to prevent h4x0rS from hacking into
                            your servers is by using JavaScript. Unfortunately, there is a very wide-spread lie that PHP
                            is the right tool for the job, but that is not true. PHP security can be avoided by simple
                            tools such as the popular FireFox extension "noPHP" which simply disables the use of PHP,
                            whereas JavaScript will stop the user from even sending malicious stuff to the server in the
                            first place!!
                        </p>

                        <p>And don't forget these three things about security:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You're most probably not a hacker, Hackerman;</li>
                            <li>Hackers are (mostly) more inteligent than you.</li>

                        <p>
                            Another extreme advantage with using JavaScript is its amazing, in-built debugging system.
                            If there is anything wrong with your code, it will promptly give you a message stating which
                            line the error is on, what the problem is, and how to fix it. What it most definitely does
                            NOT do is absolutely nothing while silently just quitting on you. (I mean seriously, thank
                            god that's not the case. otherwise people would have to resort to stuff like putting alert
                            messages LITERALLY EVERYWHERE in order to find the problem.) Another nice feature is a
                            decision by the platform designers to reduce the number of possible confusing error messages
                            by reporting the line number as "0" or "1", regardless of where the error actually occurs in
                            the code.

                        <p>
                            Anyway embedding JavaScript directly into pages is sometimes useful: true hacker frequently
                            views the html source for express code audit in case JavaScript keeps rejecting even to pass
                            they filled in web form to the sever. Lower mortals in such case call Tech Support.

                            Unlike its brother language Java, JavaScript is completely assured to work all the time, no
                            matter what OS/architecture/browser is being used. This is due to Microsoft's heroic efforts
                            to bring the whole programming community together by all using the same standards. Back in
                            the day, JavaScript hardly ever worked on any system because all the major browser creators
                            were pitted against each other, trying to each get as many users as possible. Then Bill
                            Gates was like "whoa, dude. this totally has to stop" so he nobly sacrificed Internet
                            Explorer's lead in share of users in order to cooperate with Netscape. Unfortunately there
                            are still a few browsers who do not conform to standards such as Safari, Opera, and
                            Konqerer.

                            Facebook, Twitter, Bebo, Google and many other <code>evil</code> organizations use
                            JavaScript to its full potential. Facebook set up a huge social networking website as
                            addictive as <code>crack</code>, then upped the JavaScript usage in order to cause
                            frustration and anger for its 12,842 users. Bebo has much more activity ever since Facebook
                            was created. The millions of users that were automatically registered to Facebook by
                            importing data from the CIA databases straight into Facebooks databases in order to make it
                            look like Facebook suddenly has thousands of users and eventually get everyont to willingly
                            sign up all rushed back to Bebo once they found out about Facebooks evil schemes (this has
                            not actually happened yet.. this happens in the year 2043, shhh). Unfortunately they were
                            all too late as Bebo had planted the virus on their website as well.

                            Twitter, the most <code>useless</code> website in the world manages to have non-stop
                            JavaScript running in the background. It's purpose was to waste your bandwidth, otherwise
                            known as "Geeks Gold". Bandwidth is so precious that its name is commonly shortened to
                            b&width to save the second it takes a computer nerd to type 3 letters.

                            JavaScript (hey, what else are they gonna do?). Most noticably on their Google Images pages,
                            giving the slight feel of depression when scrolling down the long, continuous page, trying
                            to focus on tiny images. Useful for looking for porn, though.

                            Uncyclopedia even uses JavaScript, although this is not by choice. JavaScript comes as a

                            around community imposed blocks.
